            <p>
              Hello, I'm Subash Neupane, a computer science student at Claflin
              University, deeply rooted in my Nepalese heritage. Throughout my
              academic journey, I've embraced various leadership roles that have
              shaped my passion for technology and community engagement. As a
              Mern Stack Developer, I have honed my skills and expertise,
              allowing me to contribute as an instructor for the National
              Society of Black Engineers on campus. This role has provided me
              with the opportunity to share my knowledge and foster a
              collaborative learning environment. In addition to my technical
              endeavors, I've held pivotal positions such as the Google
              Developer Student Club Lead and Vice President of the Global
              Student Organization. These experiences have not only broadened my
              horizons in technology but also strengthened my ability to lead
              and inspire others.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p class="aboutmore-text">
              Furthermore, I proudly serve as a Career Ambassador, assisting
              fellow students in navigating their career paths and making
              informed decisions. As a fellow of EVhybridNoire, I am dedicated
              to promoting diversity and inclusivity within the tech industry, a
              cause that resonates with my values and aspirations. Beyond
              technology, I have a profound love for public speaking, relishing
              every opportunity to share my experiences and learn from the
              stories of others. A guiding principle in my life is encapsulated
              in this quote: "Always adhere to the process; the result is merely
              the culmination of that process." This mindset propels me forward,
              reminding me to focus on the journey, confident that the results
              will naturally follow.
